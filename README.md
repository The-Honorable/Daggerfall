# Daggerfall

### Overview

This repo is intended to serve as a location to store information related to my first playthrough of The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall.

I am streaming this on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/thehonorabIe)

I've created a backstory which can be found [here](https://github.com/The-Honorable/Daggerfall/blob/main/backstory.md) or in the backstory file above

I've also created a page with the build I am using, which can be found [here](https://github.com/The-Honorable/Daggerfall/blob/main/build.md)
