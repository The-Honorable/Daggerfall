Backstory:

tldr; 

Draconis, an orphan with a low affinity for spell casting but great potential with the sword, becomes an adventurer at age ten and goes on a quest to kill some goblins. The quest goes horribly wrong when five goblins turns into dozens. On his deathbead, a great red dragon saves him and brings him back to his den high in the mountains of Skyrim. Recooperating, Draconis pledges his loyalty to the great dragon and to repay his debt for saving his life. The dragon, not looking for a pet, reluctantly allows the young boy to stay until he has fully recovered. Draconis, fully recovered now and not willing to leave, hunts to bring the dragon food, and cleans the large cave and surrounding plateau for the dragon. Eventually the dragon warms up to the boy. After several months of seeing the boy train, he asks the boy is he wishes to learn the ways of the dragon and become a fighter with no equal: a Dragon knight. Eager to learn and repay his debt and become stronger to server the great red dragon, Draconis agrees.

Over the next fifteen years, the great dragon teaches Draconis all he knows in combat, strategy, world knowledge, and spell crafting. Although Draconis did not have a strong affinity for spell crafting, he was able to absorb part of the spells cast at him and was able to cast some beginner level spells. Towards the end of his training, the great red dragon reveals he is several millennia old and his life is coming to an end. He explains there is a great ritual by which a dragon knight can absorb the essence of a dragon. Seeing Draconis as his legacy, he wishes to perform the ritual to ensure he is always with the young dragon knight. Deeply saddened upon learning that his dragon mentor was dying and that the ritual requires the dragon knight to slay the old dragon, Draconis performs the ritual and absorbs the last of the dragons essence.

After laying the great dragon to rest, he stayed at the dragons den for many months. In a state of mourning, and unsure where to go, he knew his mentor would not want him to be secluded in the mountains all of his life. He climbed down the mounts, and decided to travel until he found his new purpose. He continued to pass through villages, towns, and cities, until he reached the imperial capital of cyrodiil. From here the gate guard seeing a strong young man, and the vast potential he holds, suggests he joins the imperial army. Reluctant at first, through several encounters during Draconis' stay in the capital, he was convinced and joined the army.

Due to his great skills with the blade, strategic and tactical knowledge of war, and his proficiency in magic, he quickly rose the ranks and garnered the attention of his superiors. During a meeting of fate, the emperor's right hand man pulled Draconis aside and said "The Emperor would like to meet you. Behave yourself or prepare to lose your head."

The emperor, seeing a draconic presence within him, wanted to get to know the young man and hear his story. At first, it was just one quick meeting with guards surrounding them. Draconis explains he is just a normal knight. The emperor, insisting there is more, drags Draconis from his daily life of serving in the vanguard of the army to becoming a personal guard for the emperor. As he is closer now, the emperor takes every opportunity to learn more about the young knight. Over the years, the two met and discussed politics, issues plaguing the city, and the state of the empire. They grew quite fond, and as this friendship blossomed Draconis told his story. The story of how a young boy met a dragon, learned many skills and an abundance of knowledge, but lost his way when his mentor passed. Now with a new friendship, he finally found a greater purpose: to use his skills to better the world. 

Draconis became quite content with his new life. He was sure this is how he would spend the next few years, until the emperor called him to a secret meeting one night....
